House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project predicts the sale price of houses using the Kaggle House Prices dataset. It demonstrates a complete data science workflow: data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to estimate residential property prices based on features like size, location, condition, and amenities.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle – House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

Contains 1,460 entries and 80+ features about properties in Ames, Iowa.

Project Steps
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values using imputation or removal as appropriate.

Dropped features with too many missing entries.

Feature Engineering:

Converted categorical variables to numeric using one-hot encoding.

Modeling:

Trained a Linear Regression model to predict SalePrice.

Split data into training and testing sets for evaluation.

Evaluation:

Achieved R² Score: 0.89

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): ~29,500

Visualization & Insights:

Examined feature correlations and model performance.

Results
The model explains 89% of the variance in house prices on the test set.

Can be improved further with advanced algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost).

Tools & Technologies
Python

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn

How to Use
Download the dataset from Kaggle.

Run the Jupyter Notebook  step by step.

 Experiment with different features or models.

What I Learned:
Real-world data often has missing values and needs careful cleaning.

Regression can be a powerful tool for price/value estimation tasks.

End-to-end model building and evaluation enhances practical data science skills.
